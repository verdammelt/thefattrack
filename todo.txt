* a useful/sane way to set the version number somewhere
    - and show on about screen

* Goal Weight
    - compute when goal will be reached
    - show goal weight (and goal date)

* BMI Calculation

* Misc Stuff
    - more careful testing around graph (i.e. javascript type testing)
    - deal with possibility that weight.save fails
    - add flog/flay/etc. to rake to use easily
    - flog/flay/roodi/reek to keep code clean

* Import / Export CSV Data

* Multiple Users
    - user prefs (for BMI, weight averaging ...)

* UI Improvements
    - add email address to page
    - click graph to get details of weight/notes
    - logo from Wendy
    - twitter bootstrap to make it nicer?

* Notes on Weights

* Options for weight graph: show all or 30 day (with start/end date).

* refactor to have view deal with presenter object for weights - so that
rounding is not called from the view.

* don't save the trend data - unneeded - calculate on the fly.
