The Fat Track
=============

"They're made out of... meat."
"Ugly bags of mostly water"

Calories In / Calories Out is a simplification; but one that seems to work for
me.  I use that concept along with a trend graph of my daily weight (an idea
from The Hacker's Diet) to help me lose weight (an off-again on-again
campaign).

The graphing of weight is to provide feedback of how your diet is going. It is
important to not look at each daily weight since that will fluctuate quite a
bit.  Having a big dinner one night will cause the next morning's weight to be
much higher for example - but that is not 'weight gained' - it might just be
temporary - your body will shed some of it once it has passed through your
system.

To keep track of my weight and graph this trend I have created this Ruby on
Rails application.  

I hope that this application is useful to others too.  

Enjoy.
